=> machine learning models will study patterns and structures in data based on relationships or linkages between variables in the data.
   The model will then group this data into different clusters. This technique is known as clustering.

   Some of the unsupervised learning algorithms that are important for you to know are:

   - clustering,
   - dimensionality reduction,
   - anomaly detection,
   - density estimation.

=> clustering is an unsupervised machine learning method for grouping similar objects into a cluster.
  Because it is an unsupervised category, the dataset used in the clustering model does not have a label.

=> How is this labeling process?
  - Data that has similarities will be grouped, then each data in the same group will be given the same label.

=> A clustering model will compare the attributes of each past visitor
  create a cluster filled with visitors who have a high similarity of characteristics / attributes.

-> The very first thing K-Means do is select a random sample to be the centroid. The centroid is a sample of data that is the center of a cluster.
  We can see in the figure that the 3 samples that were used as centroids are colored blue, green and yellow.
